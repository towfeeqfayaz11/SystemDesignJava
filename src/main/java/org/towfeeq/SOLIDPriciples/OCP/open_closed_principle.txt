# Open/Closed Principle:
   Software entities like classes, functions, and modules should be open for extension but closed for
   modification. This means that you should be able to add new functionality without altering existing code.

# Why it matters:
    This principle encourages the use of abstractions and design patterns (like inheritance, composition,
    or higher-order functions) to extend behavior. By keeping existing code unchanged, you reduce the
    risk of introducing bugs and make your software more adaptable to new requirements.
