# Single Responsibility Principle:
    A class, function, or module should have only one responsibility or reason to change. This means that
    it should only do one thing, whether it’s a class managing a single piece of business logic or a
    function performing a specific task.

#  Why it matters:
    By ensuring that both classes and functions have a single responsibility, your code becomes more modular,
    easier to understand, test, and maintain. When something changes in the business requirements, you’ll
    know exactly where to make modifications.
