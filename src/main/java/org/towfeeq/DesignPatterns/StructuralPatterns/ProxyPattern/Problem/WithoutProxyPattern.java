/*
Problem Without Proxy
    Imagine a scenario where we need to fetch and display a large image in an application. Loading the
    image takes significant time and memory. The application should not block while the image is being
    loaded. We need a mechanism to load the image lazily (only when required).

Problems Without Proxy
    - Eager Initialization: The real image is loaded as soon as it is created, consuming memory and time
      even if itâ€™s not displayed.
    - Performance Impact: The application blocks while loading large images.

Solution: Proxy Pattern
    - Using the Proxy Pattern, we introduce a proxy class (ProxyImage) that represents the image. The proxy
      only loads the real image when it is required.
