Facade Design Pattern
    - In the facade pattern, a facade is an object that acts as a front-facing interface to a more complex system.
      It's a structural design pattern that's often used in object-oriented programming.
    - The Facade Design Pattern provides a simplified and unified interface to a complex subsystem.
      It hides the complexities of the subsystem by encapsulating its components and exposes only the
      necessary interfaces that the client needs to interact with.

Components in Facade Design Pattern:
    - Subsystems: The actual components or classes that perform the underlying tasks.
    - Facade: A higher-level interface that encapsulates the complexity of the subsystems.
    - Client: The entity that uses the facade to interact with the subsystem.

Key Concepts
    - Simplification: Reduces the interaction complexity between the client and the subsystem by providing
      a high-level interface.
    - Encapsulation: Ensures that the client does not need to know the intricate details of the subsystem.
    - Independence: Decouples the client from the subsystem, making the system more modular and flexible to change.


When to Use the Facade Pattern
    - You have a complex subsystem with multiple classes, and you want to simplify the interaction for clients.
    - You need to decouple clients from a subsystem to promote maintainability and flexibility.
    - You want to provide a uniform interface to multiple subsystems.


How the Facade Solves the Problem
    - Simplification: The client interacts with a single HomeAutomationFacade class instead of multiple subsystem classes.
    - Decoupling: The client is no longer tightly coupled to the subsystem implementations.
    - Reuse: Common operations (like morning and night routines) are encapsulated in the facade, reducing redundancy.

Benefits of Facade Pattern
    - Simplifies Interface: Provides a high-level, easy-to-use interface for interacting with complex subsystems.
    - Encapsulates Complexity: Hides the subsystem's implementation details from the client.
    - Reduces Coupling: Decouples the client from the subsystem, making the system more modular and maintainable.
    - Improves Readability: Enhances the code's readability and usability for clients.
    - Promotes Flexibility: Changes in subsystem implementations do not affect clients using the facade.

Drawbacks of Facade Pattern
    - Limited Flexibility for Clients: If a client needs access to specific functionalities of the subsystem not exposed
      by the facade, it might still need to interact with the subsystem directly.
    - Potential Overhead: The facade may introduce a layer of indirection, which could slightly impact performance
      in performance-critical applications.
    - Over-Generalization: If the facade tries to provide too many functionalities, it may become a "god class,"
      violating the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP).
    - Real-World Examples of Facade Pattern
    - Web Development: Using APIs like jQuery to abstract complex DOM manipulations.
    - Frameworks: Logging frameworks (e.g., SLF4J in Java) provide a facade for underlying logging implementations
      like Log4j or java.util.logging.
    - Database Access: Hibernate simplifies database interactions by acting as a facade over JDBC.

The Facade pattern is particularly useful when dealing with complex systems, ensuring that clients can focus
on their tasks without worrying about the intricate details of the system.
