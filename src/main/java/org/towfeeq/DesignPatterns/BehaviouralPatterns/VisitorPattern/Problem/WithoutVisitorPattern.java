/*
Problem:
Consider a Shape hierarchy with classes like Circle and Rectangle.
You need to perform different operations, like calculating area or rendering them on screen.
- Without the Visitor Pattern, youâ€™d add new methods to each class for every new operation,
  tightly coupling the classes to the operations.
- Adding new operations would require modifying all classes, violating the Open/Closed Principle.

Problems with This Approach:
    - Violation of Open/Closed Principle: Adding a new operation (e.g., exporting the shape
      to a file) requires modifying all shape classes.
    - Lack of Scalability: The class hierarchy becomes cluttered with unrelated methods.
    - Tight Coupling: Shapes are tightly coupled to operations.
