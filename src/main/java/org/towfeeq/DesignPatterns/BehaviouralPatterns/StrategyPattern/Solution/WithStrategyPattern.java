/*
Hereâ€™s how to use the strategy pattern to process payments dynamically.

Key Takeaways
- The Strategy Pattern eliminates conditional logic by encapsulating each algorithm into its own class.
- The Context Class interacts with the strategies through a common interface, enabling dynamic selection.
- This pattern is particularly useful in scenarios where algorithms may change or new ones need to be added frequently.
