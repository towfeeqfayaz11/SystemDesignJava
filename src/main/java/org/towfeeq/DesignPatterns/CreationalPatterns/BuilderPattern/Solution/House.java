/*
Static Inner Class:
    - HouseBuilder is a static inner class inside the House class.
    - Because it is static, it can be instantiated without an instance of the enclosing class (House).

Method Chaining:
    - Methods like setFoundation() and setHasGarden() return the same HouseBuilder object (this),
      enabling multiple calls in a single line.
    - This technique is called method chaining.

build() Method:
    - This is the final step where the HouseBuilder object is used to construct and return a House object.



--------


Static Members and Inner Classes: `General Rules`
    - Static Members Canâ€™t Access Non-Static Members Directly:
    - A static member (like a method or variable) belongs to the class rather than an instance. Hence, it cannot
      directly access non-static members because non-static members are tied to an instance of the class.

Static Inner Class Behavior:
    - A static inner class does not depend on an instance of the outer class.
    - However, it can access non-static members of the outer class via an explicit instance of the outer class.
